# C-maps

Task1. Write a program in which define a templated class mySort with private data members as a counter and an array (and anything else if required). Public member functions should include constructor(s), sortAlgorithm() and swap() functions. Main sorting logic resides in sort Algorithm() and swap function should be called inside it. Test your program inside main with integer, float and character datatypes.

Task2.Use templates to define a class TaxCalculation, functions set_taxRate and calculateTax. Test your program using main function with integer and float datatypes. 

Task3. Define a class Astrology that contains private data members as (string star), (string dob), (string dailyPrediction) and public functions as setStar, setDob, setDailyPrediction, getStar, getDob, getDailyPrediction, showReadings. Inside main function create a map <string, Astrology> and test your class with menu that offers insertion, deletion, display, size and exit options.
